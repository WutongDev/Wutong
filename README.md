## Why We Need Wutong
In our daily project development, we frequently encounter situations where we need to encode or convert certain data. For instance, converting a string to Base64 encoding or representing a number in binary format. Often, to accomplish these tasks, we have to leave our development environment, search for specialized programs or websites, perform multiple interactive operations, copy the results, and then return to our development environment. This process is not only time-consuming but also disrupts our workflow by causing frequent context-switching, which can lead to a loss of focus and valuable inspiration.

**Wutong** was created to address this issue. It is a command-line tool that allows us to complete various mundane tasks that we may encounter in programming directly within the terminal, thereby significantly enhancing our coding efficiency.
